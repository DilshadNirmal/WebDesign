It's a lot of work to create a professional website, so if you're new to web development, we encourage you to start small.

## Installing Basic Software

When it comes to tools for building a website, there's a lot to pick from. If you're just starting, you might be confused by the array of code editors, frameworks, and testing tools out there.

## What will your website look like

Before you start writing the code for your website, you should plan it first. What information are you showcasing? What fonts and colors are you using? Here we'll outline a simple method that you can follow to plan out your site's content and design.

## Dealing with files

A website consists of many files: text content, code, stylesheets, media content, and so on. When you're building a website, you need to assemble these files into a sensible structure and make sure they can talk to one another.

## HTML basics

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the code that you use to structure your web content and give it meaning and purpose. For example, is my content a set of paragraphs or a list of bullet points? Do I have images inserted on my page? Do I have a data table?

## CSS basics

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the code that you use to style your website. For example, do you want the text to be black or red? Where should content be drawn on the screen? What background images and colors should be used to decorate your website?


## JavaScript basics

JavaScript is the programming language that you use to add interactive features to your website. Some examples could be games, things that happen when buttons are pressed or data is entered in forms, dynamic styling effects, animation, and much more.
